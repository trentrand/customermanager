 ## Visiting the live website

_Additional domain names can be linked to the live website by configuring the settings on the Firebase Project Console (see above)._

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod --aot` flag for a production build.

## TODO
 - Separate the `pinned` property so each user has their own set of pinned clients
